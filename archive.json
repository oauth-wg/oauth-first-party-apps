If we remove dpop_jkt, do we make it harder for implementors of client libraries? \r\n\r\nGiven that this is a new end-point (Authorization Challenge Endpoint) and a native client, we may not need to keep support for both and we can be more prescriptive, but I wonder if we might cause confusion for implementors as we have established dpop_jkt as the least common denominator (the reason for allowing it to be used with PAR end points). Perhaps we should have similar guidance to DPoP on supporting both dpop_jkt and allowing the DPoP Header to be added to the Authorization Challenge Response?\r\n\r\nI guess the question is really if we settle dpop_jkt as a the least common denominator in all DPoP impementations?",

I also do not believe that we should override the OAuth consent MUST you refer to for this spec. \r\n\r\n1.) Since it's a first party app and IdP, then maybe we could say that the challenge/response mechanism can include the \"consent_required\" error code (borrowed from OIDC) as a challenge response to the client. The client MAY automatically respond to this in the affirmative without prompting/notifying the user. \r\n\r\n2.) An alternative could be adding an additional request parm to the challenge endpoint to trigger consent suppression. \"explicit consent of the resource owner\" per 6749 does not need to be a flow interruption. Since it's a first party app this consent can also be provided through EULA/ToS/etc. Performing the consent suppression in this manner would also reduce compute I/O and end user latency because it removes the extra consent challenge/response introduced the previous paragraph. \r\n\r\nThe problem with both is that consent is also a regulatory requirement. Either option would need to have a call out explaining that how the client and the AS manage consent updates/versioning is out of scope for this spec (e.g. multiple versions of multiple different apps still active). \r\n\r\nThere could also some form of a consent_version request parm included in both options for what that client currently supports. That would cleanly fit option 2. For option 1 & option 2 there could be a new consent_version_required challenge response to the client. How that versioning reconciliation occurs should be outside the scope of this spec. For example though, the client could update/natively obtain the ability to fulfil requested consent version. If nothing else, both options can default to a webview where existing mechanisms to handle consent can be fulfilled if there is an irreconcilable conflict. \r\n\r\nThere are very valid first party use cases where it is still appropriate to collect user consent. It's also likely that some of those same use cases in existing platforms have a way to display previously granted consents and allow the user to revoke individual apps/features. This is definitely a topic worthy of its own section no matter what the final text ends up being. \r\n\r\n@gffletch @aaronpk thoughts? ",

It's an abbreviation for Short Message Service or Short Messaging Service, see for example https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS\r\nAlso maybe the document should be circumspect about whether the use case applies only to SMS or could be applied to similar services such as USSD.\r\n\r\nFor example, this part could be rewritten.\r\n\r\n> ## SMS Confirmation Code\r\n> A user may be required to provide an SMS confirmation code as part of an authentication ceremony to prove they control a\r\n> mobile phone number. The user provides a phone number and is then required to enter an SMS confirmation code sent to the\r\n> phone. If the correct confirmation code is returned to the Authorization Server, it issues Access and Refresh Tokens.\r\n\r\nEdited version could be like this.\r\n\r\n> ## Mobile Confirmation Code\r\n> A user may be required to provide a confirmation code as part of an authentication ceremony to prove they control a mobile phone number. The user provides a phone number and is then required to enter a confirmation code sent to the phone by SMS (Short Messaging Service) or a similar mobile service. If the correct confirmation code is returned to the Authorization Server, it issues Access and Refresh Tokens.\r\n",

The authorization server MUST check the DPoP proof JWT that was included in the DPoP header as defined in Section 4.3 of {{RFC9449}}. The authorization server MUST ensure that the same key is used in all subsequent Authorization Challenge Requests, or in the eventual token request.
